# AgObservatory

The Agriculture Intelligence Observatory and aWhere are working in partnership to support the World Bank and partners to access and deploy high resolution and geospatial ag-meteorological data.

## Objectives

This repository aims to enable World Bank Group staff and partners to easily access the latest functions and scripts developed by aWhere in collaboration with the Ag Observatory. It also aims to create a space where other teams working with aWhere data within the WBG may provide feedback and improve analytical capabilities of current functions and scripts.

## Getting started

1) Create a trial* account to aWhere platform at www.awhere.com 
2) Create an trial* account to the aWhere Developer Community 
3) Create an App and retrieve API keys
4) Explore script folder: start with DataQuery_API 


*Contact Caroline (csartoratosilvaf@worldbank.org) to consult on possibilities for extension of trial under the Ag Observatory license
