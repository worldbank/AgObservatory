# AgObservatory

The Agriculture Intelligence Observatory and aWhere are working in partnership to support the World Bank teams, clients and partners to access and deploy high resolution and geospatial agrometeorological data.

## Objectives

This repository aims to enable World Bank Group staff and Ag Observatory trainees to easily access the latest scripts and functions developed by aWhere in collaboration with the Ag Observatory for data access, visualization and analysis. It also aims to create a space so others may provide feedback and help improve current training material, script and functions. 

## Getting started

1) Create a trial* account to aWhere platform at www.awhere.com 
2) Create an trial* account to the aWhere Developer Community 
3) Create an App and retrieve API keys
4) Explore current scripts/tutorials and reach out to Caroline (csartoratosilvaf@worldbank.org) for assistance as well as to consult on possibilities for extension of trial under the Ag Observatory license.
