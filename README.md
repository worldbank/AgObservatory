# AgObservatory

The Ag Observatory supports the World Bank teams, clients and partners to easily access and deploy near real-time, high resolution and geospatial agrometeorological data via private sector providers. 

## Objectives

This repository aims to enable World Bank Group staff and Ag Observatory trainees to easily access the latest scripts and functions developed by aWhere Inc. in collaboration with the Ag Observatory for data access, visualization and analysis. It also aims to create a space so others may provide feedback and help improve current training material, script and functions. 

## Getting started

1) Create a trial account to aWhere platform at https://apps.awhere.com/
2) Create a trial account to the aWhere Developer Community https://developer.awhere.com/
3) Create an App and retrieve API keys
4) Explore current scripts/tutorials and reach out to Caroline (csartoratosilvaf@worldbank.org) for assistance as well as to consult on possibilities for extension of trial under the Ag Observatory license.
