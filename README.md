# AgObservatory

Ag Observatory and aWhere partnership to support the World Bank and partners to access and deploy high resolution and geospatial ag-meteorological data.

## Objectives

This repository has the objective to enable World Bank Group staff and partners to easily access the latest functions and scrips developed by aWhere in collaboration with the Ag Observatory. It also aims to create a space where other teams working with aWhere data within the WBG may provide feedback and improve analytical capabilities.
